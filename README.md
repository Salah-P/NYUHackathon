# Poolara ‚Äî Campus Ridesharing for Students

A vibrant, playful, and secure web app that helps students share rides, split costs, and build community. 

## üöó What is Poolara?
**Poolara** is a student-first ridesharing platform designed to make getting around campus easier, cheaper, and greener. Built with Next.js, React, and an energetic palette inspired by our logo (purple, magenta, coral, navy), Poolara delivers an ultra-modern, youthful experience for students everywhere. 

**Why Poolara?** Because campus journeys are better when shared with friends! Poolara lets you:
- **Share or find rides** for classes, events, or weekend trips
- **Split costs automatically** (no awkward math!)
- **Reduce your carbon footprint** (every shared ride counts)
- **Connect with classmates safely** (only .edu/university email join)
